Ingestion is done by [Sentry Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay). Relay is a service for event filtering, rate-limiting and processing.

It can act as:

* the store endpoint for your Sentry installation. See [Relay developer
  documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/relay/relay/).
* an additional middle layer between your application and Sentry. See [Relay product
  documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/).
